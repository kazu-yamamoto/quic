# ChangeLog

## 0.2.10

* Fix a bug of ACK on retransmission.
* New scheme to pack ACK on handshake.
* Fix a race condition in closure. CC is broken sometime.
* Using Rate instead of TBQueue against DOS.
* Enhancing qlog.
* Cleaning up the code for migration.
* Anti-amplification for migration.
* Respecting active_connection_id_limit.
* If `ccWatchDog` is `True`, a watch dog thread is spawn to call
  `migration` when network configuration changes.

  to use connected sockets.
* Fixing time representation of qlog.

## 0.2.9

* Don't send Fin if connection is already closed.
* Using clientWantSessionResumeList for multiple tickets.

## 0.2.8

  Note that the CID of stateless reset is random.
  Test: `quic-server -o 5` and `quic-client -i`/`p`.
